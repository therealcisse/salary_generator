Problem description: Salary slip generator for a German company

In Germany salary slip contains employee details like employee tax id, employee name and their monthly salary details like their gross salary, national insurance contributions, tax-free allowance, taxable income and tax payable.
Salary slips are generated each month for every employee.

Acceptance criteria:
Salary slip generator should receive a list of employees with their Employee Tax ID, Name and Annual Gross Salary
Salary slip should contain the Employee Tax ID, Employee Name, Gross Salary, Medical Insurance contributions, Tax-free allowance, Taxable income and Tax payable for the month
Basic error handling should be implemented, e.g Employee Tax ID should exist, Employee Name should be defined, Gross Salary should not be 0 or negative.
The entry point should be the following interface, which you can not change:
      class SalarySlipGenerator {
        def generateFor(employees: List[Employee]): List[SalarySlip]
      }
You can, of course, add private methods and fields to the SalarySlipGenerator class, change the constructor, and add extra classes.
Iteration 1: for any annual salary
This is the most basic case. For example,
Given We have an employee Peter Mustermann with an annual gross salary of 5,000.00 Euro
When We generate a monthly salary slip for the employee
Then the monthly salary slip should contain the below:
   Employee Tax ID: 12345
   Employee Name: Peter Mustermann
   Gross Salary: 416.67 Euro
Calculation rules:
Monthly Gross Salary: The monthly gross salary is the employee's annual gross salary divided by 12
